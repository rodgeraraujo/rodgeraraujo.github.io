				<p class="text">These materials included Benzole emulsion, Pestend, Clift's manurual insecticide and 'Harbas' red oil, as well as Paris green, lead arsenate, and various tobacco preparations. Lead arsenate was recommended for home garden use in the control of cabbage moth, cutworm, pumpkin beetle, slugs and snails, as well as codlin moth, and small tins of lead arsenate for home garden use were available from seedsmen. It is likely that some home gardeners welcomed the opportunity to abandon the time-consuming practice of trunk bandaging, particularly as they were assured that it would 'not be necessary if the trees are sprayed several times with arsenate of lead'.2 harry Simpson grew up at Rosemont, a stately home set in one and a quarter acres of garden in the Melbourne suburb of Surrey Hills. The garden consisted mainly of fruit trees and roses, and some 60 years later, Harry recalled that 'The everlasting spraying seemed to go on endlessly. Arsenate of lead was all that was used as far as I can remember though I think nicotine came in somewhere'.3</p>
